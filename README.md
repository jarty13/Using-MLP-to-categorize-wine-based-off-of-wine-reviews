* Using multilayer proceptron to categorize 16 different categories of wines, based off of wine reviews. 
* Utlizied Kaggle Wine Enthusiast data set
* Explored different regularizaiton methods from early stoping, L1, L2 and Drop out in order to achieve 62% accuracy in categorizing the type of wine based off of the wine review.
